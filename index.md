###IT Architecture
<span class="archiwise">archi<b>wise</b></span> in a nutshell: 
- we specialise in consulting on <i>software architecture</i> and <i>solution architecture</i>;
- we focus on vendor-neutral advice for strategic ICT projects, including on architecture design, specification, audit, reconstruction, etc; 
- we value practical, no-nonsense architectural solutions that improve the quality of your software;
- we are actively involved: close collaboration on-site, as team lead/member, as external auditor, as organizer of trainings, etc.


At <span class="archiwise">archi<b>wise</b></span>, our passion for IT architecture goes beyond our consulting services:  
- our [roots](/about.html) are in software <i>architecture research</i> (at <a href="http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/" target="_blank">DistriNet</a>/<a href="http://www.kuleuven.be/" target="_blank">KU Leuven</a>);
- we co-founded [BelgAF](http://www.belgaf.be) (<b>Bel</b>gian <b>A</b>rchitecture <b>F</b>orum), a non-profit organisation that enables IT architects to share knowledge and experiences;
- we regularly organise [sessions](/sessions.html) at various events to consolidate and share what we have learned;
- we are convinced learning is fun, which is embodied by [softwarewolves](http://www.softwarewolves.net), an engaging one-day coding contest for developers that combines both entertainment and learning;
