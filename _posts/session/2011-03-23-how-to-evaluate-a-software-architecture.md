####Learning Objectives:
After this session, participants will have a better understanding of:

- What quality attributes such as reliability, performance,
  modifiability, etc. mean, and how to specify them in a measurable
  way. 
- How quality attributes affect a software architecture
- Why architecture analysis is important
- How QAW and ATAM are performed
- Do's and don'ts when performing architecture evaluations

####Abstract
Most complex software systems should be modifiable, performant,
secure, flexible, portable, reliable, etc. But how do you know
whether the software architecture for a system will achieve these
goals (or not) without having to build the system first? Is there a
structured way to analyze/measure a software architecture? 

In this interactive session, we discuss to which extent
architectures can be evaluated and we highlight approaches that
support architecture evaluation in a systematic way, including the
Quality Attribute Workshop (QAW) and the Architecture Tradeoff
Analysis Method (ATAM). The QAW is a lightweight,
stakeholder-oriented workshop aimed at prioritizing and specifying
architecture qualities in a measurable way. The ATAM is an
established method for systematically evaluating software
architectures for fitness of purpose. The ATAM exposes architectural
risks that potentially inhibit the achievement of quality goals and
the system's business/mission goals. Empirical measurements show
that a structured architecture evaluation saves about 10% of the
total cost of a software project.
