categories: session

####Learning objectives:
- Understand security in the context of the ISO 42010 standard on
  architecture descriptions.
- Basic understanding of architecture views, viewpoints and how to
  apply them for security.
- Gain insight into specifying quality scenarios for security.
- Learn to make architecture tradeoffs using utility trees and use
  architecture evaluations (ATAM).
####Overview:
In this talk, we highlight security from a software architecture
perspective. A software architect considers security in relation to
many other qualities, such as performance, availability,
extensibility, time-to-market,... We discuss the implications of
considering security as one architectural quality amongst many
others, and give an overview of how typical architectural techniques
and practices, such as quality attribute scenarios, utility trees,
principles, viewpoints and architectural patterns, can be applied to
security.
