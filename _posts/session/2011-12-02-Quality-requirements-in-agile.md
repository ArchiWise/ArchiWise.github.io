categories: session

####Abstract
he success of software is not only in the functions it supports,
but also in the qualities it exhibits (like security, performance,
usability and maintainability). In this session, we want to
investigate how these qualities can be addressed, particularly how
they can be described, planned and tracked within an agile work
flow. Quality requirements are also often referred to as
*non-functional* requirements.

In this session, participants will gain hands-on experience with
several techniques (like acceptance criteria on user stories,
dedicated user stories, adjustments on the definition of done,
abuser stories) for explicitly managing quality requirements in an
agile project. Participants will be divided in small groups and
choose one or two qualities to experiment with within the context of
an example system. Each group will experiment with one or more
techniques and share experiences through review of each others'
results and plenary discussion.
