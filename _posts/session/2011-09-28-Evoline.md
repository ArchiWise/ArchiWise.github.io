####Abstract
Software product lines evolve. As a consequence, deployed products
of the product line need to be updated and maintained, which is
often a nightmare due to custom configurations, patches, lack of
documentation. In this session, we present Evoline, an architectural
approach for evolution in software product lines. Evoline supports
updating a software product line by extracting and visualizing
architectural information. We evaluated Evoline at Egemin, a leading
provider of warehouse automation solutions, and show empirical
evidence for its benefits and recommendations.
