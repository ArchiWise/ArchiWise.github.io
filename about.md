###About us

Alexander and Nelis, the two founders of <span class="archiwise">archi<b>wise</b></span>, started their collaboration as researchers at the Department of Computer Science of the K.U.Leuven. Together they have been involved in many industry projects and research activities on software architecture for complex distributed systems. Over the years they gained expert knowledge on the latest architectural approaches and applied these in different domains.

In many industry collaborations, they have shown that tailoring architectural practices to the needs of an organization and exploiting automation rather than documentation are key factors to improve both agility and software quality. At <span class="archiwise">archi<b>wise</b></span>, they assist organizations in exploiting state-of-the-art architectural methods, techniques and tools.
