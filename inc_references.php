<h2>Quickscan</h2>

<p>Based on a snappy inspection, archiwise provides you with a crisp overview of concrete actions to boost the agility and end-to-end quality of your software development.</p>
</div>

<div id="audit" class="contentdetail">
<h2>Architecture Audit</h2> 
<p>Do you need an external expert opinion on a major software overhaul? Do you need to identify the key challenges for a next generation of the software? Do you have a lot of quality issues with the software you develop?</p>
<p>Archiwise can evaluate your software architecture to safeguard important qualities and to mitigate risks. A structured architectural evaluation saves more than 10% of the total project cost [1] by identifying risks early in development when they're less expensive to fix. Our staff is experienced and certified in performing architecture evaluations using ATAM [2].</p>
</div>

<div id="automation" class="contentdetail">
<h2>quality automation</h2>
<p>Is the structure of your code impossible to understand? Are you struggling to keep architecture and implementation in sync? Does updating your systems give you headaches?</p>
<p>
Using a combination of automated architectural reconstruction and analysis on the actual software, archiwise can help you to detect and correct problems more quickly and reliably:
<ul><li><b>Quality assurance</b> 
<p>automated monitoring of key architectural qualities increases development speed and ensures the delivery of quality software. Our approach has shown an increase in deployment speed with 35% while reducing inconsistencies with 50%.</p>
<li><b>Legacy control</b> 
<p>regain control over legacy systems by automated reconstruction of architectural information.</p></li></ul>
